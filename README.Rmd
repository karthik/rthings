# rthings

This package is a thin wrapper around `list.design`. The website says: _Lists a gallery of real data ready to be placed in your design. Kind of like an App Store for fake content. Want to design with real data ? There's a list for that._

```{r}
library(rthings)
(x <- stuff())
# and if you want to get a list of random Companies, then:

library(magrittr)  
x %>% .[which(x == "Companies")] %>% get_list()
```
