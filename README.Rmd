# rthings

This package is a thin wrapper around [`list.design`](http://lists.design/). The website says: _Lists a gallery of real data ready to be placed in your design._ So if you need a random list of things to populate an example or a demo, here goes. ðŸ“‹

```{r}
library(rthings)
(x <- stuff())
```


and if you want to get a list of say random Companies, then:


```{r}
library(tidyverse)  
x %>% .[which(x == "Companies")] %>% get_list()
```

That's it!
